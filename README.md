## Description

Easy Exports speeds up exports for backups of your [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) world. Instead of right-clicking every journal, scene, and actor, simply right-click the section in the Sidebar and pick the Easy Export option from the pop-up window (next to the Close button)

## Install

1. Go to the "Add-on Modules" tab in Foundry Setup
2. Click "Install Module" and paste this link: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opus1217/easy-exports/master/module.json`
3. Open your world and go to Settings>Manage Modules and enable Easy Exports

## Using Easy Exports
1. Start your world
2. Right-click on the tab in the Sidebar (Scenes, Actors, Items, Journals, Rollable Tables, Playlists, and Compendiums) to open the pop-out
3. Pick the Easy Export option from the title bar of the pop-out (next to the Close option)
4. The contents of the window will be exported recursively into an Easy Exports sub-folder of your World (under FoundryVTT/Data)
5. You can then copy, backup, or re-import individual JSON files as needed
