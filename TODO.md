# BUGS


# REFACTORING
- case statement on allowable entities can be replaced with comparison against SIDEBAR_ENTITIES

# FEATURES
- Change "Easy Export" in title bar to just "Export"

- Way to do time-triggered Export? 
    - Not clear you can do this without popping up the File write dialog at the time you're writing (in other words, I don't think you can defer this)

# COMPLETED FEATURES
v0.5.0 Button in basic controls or in Export/Import dialog to do Full Backup (actually just separate exports)
        - Will need a corresponding re-import to handle this (select which COmpendiums you want to bring back)
